# VirtuaPet app

This is a personal project intended as a starter project to learn Android programming, and to serve as submission as a final project for the Mobile App course. Inspiration is heavily drawn from childhood experiences of playing with Tamagotchi devices and Digimon Digivice toys.

### Please note:
This is a work in progress. Large revisions may come in the future, and sloppy comments and TODO's will be scattered throughout the code. This is not a reflection of the quality of a finished program, but rather a rough draft being worked on slowly.
